					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p id="pStyle">
						Mozambique, located in southeastern Africa, is known for
						its rich natural resources, including coal, gas, and
						valuable minerals, which play a key role in its economy.
						Mozambique borders Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe,
						South Africa, and Eswatini. The country boasts a
						stunning coastline along the Indian Ocean, featuring
						coral reefs, islands, and vibrant marine life.
						Mozambiqueâ€™s cultural landscape is a fusion of African
						and Portuguese influences, stemming from its colonial
						history. The countryâ€™s modern history has been shaped by
						its fight for independence from Portugal in 1975 and a
						long civil war that followed. Despite these challenges,
						Mozambiqueâ€™s capital, Maputo, remains a bustling port
						city and the economic heart of the nation, showing
						resilience and growth over time.

				<h2>History</h2>
				<section class="infoFig">
					<p style="width: 60%">
						Mozambique's historical narrative encompasses the
						migration of Bantu-speaking groups around 400 AD and the
						formation of trade networks by 1000 AD. The Portuguese
						began to exert their influence in 1498, achieving
						substantial control over trade routes by the period of
						1500 to 1700. The struggle for independence from
						Portuguese colonial rule occurred between 1964 and 1974,
						culminating in the country's independence in 1975. This
						period was subsequently marked by a civil conflict that
						lasted from 1977 until 1992. In the years following the
						civil war, Mozambique has experienced significant
						political transformations, including the transition to a
						multi-party political system in 1990, alongside ongoing
						challenges posed by a jihadist insurgency.

				<h2>Culture</h2>
				<section class="infoFig">
					<p style="width: 60%">
						Mozambique is characterized by a variety of ethnic
						groups, with classifications that have evolved due to
						its colonial past. The Makua-Lomwe, Tsonga, Sena, among
						others, populate the area, which is geographically
						divided by the Zambezi River into matrilineal societies
						in the northern region and patrilineal societies in the
						southern region. Over the years, numerous matrilineal
						communities have transitioned to patrilineal structures.
						While Portuguese is commonly spoken, especially in urban
						areas, Bantu languages such as Makua, Tsonga, and Sena
						are predominant. This linguistic diversity is indicative
						of Mozambique's interactions with neighboring nations,
						contributing to its vibrant cultural tapestry.

				<h2>Customs</h2>
				<section class="infoFig">
					<p style="width: 60%">
						Mozambican culture is fundamentally anchored in familial
						and communal traditions, shaped more by regional customs
						than by overarching national ideologies. Despite the
						disruptions caused by civil conflict, which included
						governmental resistance to practices such as polygamy
						and initiation ceremonies, numerous traditional customs
						have endured. The typical daily diet frequently features
						staples such as cassava and cornmeal porridge, often
						served with sauces like matapa. The culinary landscape
						also reflects Indian and Portuguese influences, as seen
						in popular dishes like chicken piri-piri and rice pilaf.
						Additionally, the availability of fresh fruits such as
						mango and papaya enhances the nutritional variety of the
						local diet.
