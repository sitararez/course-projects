						Mozambique, located in southeastern Africa, is known for
						its rich natural resources, including coal, gas, and
						valuable minerals, which play a key role in its economy.
						The country boasts a stunning coastline along the Indian
						Ocean, featuring coral reefs, islands, and vibrant
						marine life. Mozambique’s cultural landscape is a fusion
						of African and Portuguese influences, stemming from its
						colonial history.
					</p>

					<p>
						The country’s modern history has been shaped by its
						fight for independence from Portugal in 1975 and a long
						civil war that followed. Despite these challenges,
						Mozambique’s capital, Maputo, remains a bustling port
						city and the economic heart of the nation, showing
						resilience and growth over time.
